# scarlet
A small and tiny HTTP server for testing
Based on https://github.com/OminiaVincit/http_server

This one is very experimental though. Read the code and use it for fun
In future It may develop into some Web Application framework like Bottle or flask or may be something else.
Who knows.... better you  suggest and try ;)
